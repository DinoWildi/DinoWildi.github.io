### Welcome to my website!
&ensp; &ensp; I am a **postdoctoral researcher** at the **Ruprechts-Karls-Universität Heidelberg**, where I work in the ClimateDivide research project headed by [Endre Borbáth](https://endre-borbath.eu/). I currently work at identifying political claims made by various actors about climate protection and climate change across various European countries, using a variety of state-of-the-art text analysis methods. This data will later be used to research the dynamics of politicising climate change, and to identify actors driving this policitisation.

### Alongside this project,
&ensp; &ensp; I also do work on the influence of populist radical right parties on European party systems. In this field, I look in particular at **negative campaigning against the radical right**, and at the way in which the **electoral threat** of the radical right shifts the issue emphasis and positions of competing parties. I have been able to show that radical right parties elicit strong reactions from their competitors, and that this effect is largely consistent across various countries. Future research will explore the conditions under which these reactions occur, and how they are shaped by competition dynamics. You can find a list of my published and forthcoming papers and projects on the Research tab.

### Previously,
&ensp; &ensp; I have obtained my PhD at **University College Dublin** (defended in March 2025). My PhD thesis focused on radical right challenger parties in European democracies, using a quantitative and comparative approach. Chapters of it have been published in Party Politics and are part of a forthcoming edited volume. **Outside academia,** I have also worked as a sports journalist for multiple years and did a research internship at an NGO. You can find my full history on the CV tab.

### Privately, 
&ensp; &ensp; I enjoy creative endeavours - playing the guitar, knitting, bookbinding, and writing. I am a major sports fan, in particular of football, ice hockey, and cycling, and regularly go bouldering and occasionally hiking in summer. Music also plays a big role in my life: besides my guitar, I like concerts, and have gone to multiple Eurovision Song Contests.
